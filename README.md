# Crowdfunding Analysis
## Overview of Project
### In this project our goal is to provide insights to Louise about how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals. To help with the same we are using excel visualization techniques to see campaign outcomes based on their launch dates and their funding goals.
## Analysis and Challenges
### To start with the analysis we created a pivot table through which we were able to summarize the outcome of each theater campaign and their respective launch dates. Although the pivot table contains all the required information, in order to provide a visual summary, we created a line chart using the same data which highlights the relation between different campaign outcomes with their launch date.

### Further, to see how campaigns performed in relation to their funding goals, we divided campaigns into different buckets based on their goals. We created 12 buckets to show the range of funding goal for each campaign. Then for each of these buckets we calculated the percentage of successful, failed and cancelled campaigns.

### Possible challenges one could encounter would be in relation to the calcaluting the number of successful/failed/cancelled campaigns based on the buckets created for funding goals.
## Results
- The analysis shows that majority of the campaigns launched in May have been successful. This implies that May can be considered as the best month for launch of theater campaigns. 
- We can aslo see that the ouctomes of campaigns launched in first half of the year are relatively better as compared to those launched in the second half.
- Campaigns with goals greater $45000 have the worst success rate as compared to others.
- There are certain campaigns in the dataset for which goal is a small number such $1. This shows that we might have unclean data.
- We could also analyze the outcomes of different campaigns based on country. Adding this additional factor could help make a better decision about launch of campaigns.
